marc2frbr FRBRizer tool
=========
The marc2frbr FRBRizer is an open-source tool. The tool supports the conversion of records in the MARC format to a normalized set of records based on the FRBR model. The tool is implemented in XSLT and requires Java Runtime Environment 1.6+.

FRBRizer utilizes a set of rules encoded in an XML file. An example of such rules file is given in `examples/marc21/marc21.rules.xml`. 

The `example` folder includes a demonstration of the tool. Simply run:
 `sh examples/marc21/run_conversion.sh`. 

 This example is based on `MARC21` but the tool is generic enough and can easily be adapted to other dialects of MARC.
